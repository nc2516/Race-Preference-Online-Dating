      <h2>
        There are many factors that play into peopleâ€™s preferences and biases, but the reality is discrimination is disguised in the idea of preferences. Datings apps have been able to reveal inherit discrimination even if there are no race filters by seeing who swipes left (no) on who, and compiling that data to reveal patterns. While the popular dating app among gay men, Grindr, has chosen to remove race filters following the Black Lives Matter movement, other apps have chosen to keep their race filters, saying it benefits minorities who do not want to be fetishized. However, whether or not there are race filters may not matter, since roots of bias run deep into our subconscious. 
        <br /><br />
        In a study conducted by Wei-Chin Hwang, 2,832 dating profiles from LA were chosen at random from a dating app to be sampled. Four racial groups were chosen (White, Black, Latino, and Asian). 354 male and females for each racial group, who were looking for heterosexual relationships.
        <br /><br />
In order to generalize findings to individuals of one race, the relatively small number of data from mixed-race individuals was excluded from the analysis. Which resulted in 2,123 collected  (523 Asians, 504 Blacks, 473 Latinos, and 632 Whites).
